**KOHTO25 - Hybrid Intelligent Assessment System for Inclusive and Ethical GenAI Use in Higher Education** - The Hybrid Intelligent Assessment System for Inclusive and Ethical GenAI Use in Higher Education (HIAS) project seeks to transform higher education by developing, piloting, and validating a multilingual, module-based assessment system that integrates artificial intelligence in an inclusive, ethical, and pedagogically sound way. By aligning with Estonia’s AI Leap Initiative, the EU Digital Education Action Plan (2021–2027), and the DigComp 3.0 framework, HIAS aims to make assessment more transparent, student-centered, and future-ready. At its core, the project is designed to support self-regulated learning (SRL), enhance fairness and inclusivity in assessment, and create a scalable model that balances the strengths of human and AI co-agency. To achieve these objectives, HIAS actively engages educators, students, and policy actors in co-creation processes that include prototype development, international piloting, usability testing, and learning analytics evaluation. The project outcomes will include a digital assessment tool capable of supporting multilingual and modular use, alongside a governance framework that ensures full compliance with the EU AI Act and maintains strong pedagogical oversight. It will also deliver a comprehensive methodology for embedding SRL strategies, guided by the SOLO taxonomy and aligned with DigComp 3.0 proficiency levels, as well as open resources, guidelines, and policy recommendations that can be replicated across Europe.

**DITEC – Didactic Technologies for IT Education** - The Didactic Technologies for IT Education (DITEC) project seeks to redefine IT education in Europe by developing and testing innovative didactic methodologies and technologies that make higher education more relevant, attractive, and future-proof for students, industry, and society. Its main objectives are to strengthen IT didactics, bridge the gap between academia, industry, and end-users, and pilot a new “Innovation in IT Education” course designed as a scalable and adaptable model across Europe. To achieve this, DITEC engages businesses, end-users, educators, and students in co-creation processes, using design sessions, industry roundtables, workshops, surveys, focus groups, and pilot courses to build a holistic model of IT education that is technically strong, socially relevant, and pedagogically innovative. The project will deliver a methodology for continuous collaboration between IT education providers and industry, micro-courses co-designed with stakeholders, a pilot blended-learning course tested in an international boot camp, as well as open-access resources, guidelines, and a replication toolkit for other institutions. These results will not only improve IT education within the consortium but also contribute to a wider European movement for modernizing IT didactics and addressing the continent’s IT skills shortage.

+ **TILK (Scientific Innovative Approach and Meetings)** - is an educational development project aimed at improving the quality of education for IT College students. It offers a three-step approach to help students successfully reach their thesis writing. The project includes several seminars and the development of materials. 
Program directors and research experts will work together to clarify the requirements for educational materials and teaching methods. They will develop both theoretical and practical guidelines to support students at every stage of their studies. Additionally, program directors and thesis supervisors will assess the quality of the materials created. New courses and supervision meetings will be piloted to gather feedback. Finally, the results of this pilot project will be analyzed, and there will be discussions about the potential introduction of a foundational research course in the spring semester of the second year.

+ **AIRE (AI & Robotics Estonia) demoproject** - TalTech IT Didactics Research Group and Pihlakodu AS started a collaboration within the AIRE (AI & Robotics Estonia) demoproject, where the usage scenarios of the TEMI robot as an activity supervisor are designed to improve the well-being of the elderly in nursing homes, the necessary application is adapted for this purpose and it is validated as a solution to assist the activity supervisors in the daily work of Viimsi and Tabasalu nursing homes. The main goal of the project is to increase the well-being of bedridden clients by offering them an additional means of obtaining information and socializing and to test the possibility of reducing the challenges caused by the lack of nursing home staff, especially in the care of the elderly who need a more personal approach. 

+ **PYNT (Present Yet Not There)** -  creating an international community of both research institutions and end-users who are interested in developing and promoting different types of remote communication methods and in particular, robotics.

+ **EuroTEQ international course "Enhancing Social Interaction in Education and Business by using Telepresence Robots"** - the core idea of the course is to discover the capabilities of telepresence robotics (TPR) in enhancing social interaction and learn to deploy, configure and extend such robots. The course consists of six learning experience modules, 1 ECTS each: (1) video conferencing vs TPR; (2) social and ethical aspects of TPR; (3) TPR in collaborative learning; (4) teaching tele-presented students - opportunities and challenges; (5) the technical limitations of TPR; (6) how TPR technically work and how to modify them.\

+ **EuroTEQ** - the goal of the project is to diversify and update the didactic repertoire of IT college teachers, making it more suitable for hybrid learning and various forms of online learning, including synchronous hybrid learning, telepresence robots.  We translate and work through the material prepared by [Climate-KIC Holding](https://www.climate-kic.org/), which is aimed specifically at courses that use the blended learning format.\
We are piloting the autumn semester study by involving telepresence robots, including students who participate in the study via the robot.

+ **ReSTELA** - is aimed to create robotics labs, where students can participate remotely. Current plan includes a compact computer that can be accessed using some remote connection protocol (VNC, RDP etc.) connected to a programmable microcontrolled with sensors and actuators. In addition to remotely programming the controller student will have a feedback of his/her actions using a camera installed over the working area.
ReSTELA is a joint project between TalTech IT College (that’s us), [European Centre for Emerging Competencies and Technologies](https://ecect.eu/) and [Scuola di Robotica](https://www.scuoladirobotica.it/en/home-eng/).\
