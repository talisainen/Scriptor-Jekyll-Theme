The research focus of our group awakes much interest among graduate students and the number of PhD candidates in our research group grows in both quality and quantity. Kristi Marmor and Fuad Budagov (sorry Fuad, we couldn’t find you for the photo) not only enthusiastically joined our research, but successfully passed their first attestation along with Tiina Kasuk and Aleksei Talisainen – both second-year students. Congratulations to all of you!
