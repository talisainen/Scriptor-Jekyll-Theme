In addition to the participation in the seminar we visited Dr. [Ismail Khalil](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ismail-Khalil-6) and Dr. [Karin Anna Hummel](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karin-Hummel-3) from the Institute of Cooperation of Johannes Kepler University research interests lay within human-machine and machine-machine interaction, and also IoT sensors.
We share the belief that telepresence robots could strongly benefit from the results of Ismail and Karin research.

Professor [Zsolt Lavicza](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zsolt-Lavicza) our research group met the next day shared his considerations on STEM education research methods that our [EuroteQ course](documents\Enhancing-Social-Interaction-in-Education-and-Business-by-using-Telepresence-Robots-ICY0032.pdf) on social interactions using telepresence robots will greatly benefit from. We are looking forward to future cooperation.

the campus of [Johannes Kepler University](https://www.jku.at/en) is worth a separate mention, as an example of a stylish and at the same time cozy place to work and rest, located in the most picturesque landscape one could image. We can only envy our colleagues, but in a polite way, of course.

Travel tip: although there is an airport in Linz be sure to take the train, otherwise you might end up being the only person who took a flight to the city. In addition to that dubious achievement train schedule is much more flexible.
