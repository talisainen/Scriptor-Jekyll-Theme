the campus of [Johannes Kepler University](https://www.jku.at/en) is worth a separate mention, as an example of a stylish and at the same time cozy place to work and rest, located in the most picturesque landscape one could image. We can only envy our colleagues, but in a polite way, of course.

Travel tip: although there is an airport in Linz be sure to take the train, otherwise you might end up being the only person who took a flight to the city. In addition to that dubious achievement train schedule is much more flexible.
