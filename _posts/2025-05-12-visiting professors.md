Last week we had the pleasure of hosting guest professors Uglješa Marianovich and Slavko Rakic from the University of Novi Sad, Serbia. Their visit brought valuable insights and inspiration to both our staff and students.

Professor Uglješa together with professor Slavko led a lecture-workshop for our college staff and students, sharing practical approaches and fresh perspectives on academic collaboration and development. The lecture-workshop explored the application of strategic management principles — formulation, implementation, and evaluation — to improve the success of projects led by MBA-qualified IT professionals. Participants learned how to apply strategic concepts in project environments, avoid common planning pitfalls, and enhance their professional competitiveness through clearer strategic thinking and execution.
