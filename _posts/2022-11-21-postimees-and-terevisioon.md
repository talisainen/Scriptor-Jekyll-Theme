Our research group activity drew attention of one of the most popular newspapers in Estonia and "Postimees" published an article named ["Can't attend the event yourself? No problem, telepresence robot can"](https://teadus.postimees.ee/7653783/ise-ei-saa-kohale-minna-pole-viga-kaugosalusrobot-laheb).
The article was discussed on the television the next day and we are very happy about that, however the host skipped the "read the article yourself" homework and remained wondering what the application of telepresence robots might be. We would be more than glad to explain that in many details should we be given an opportunity.
