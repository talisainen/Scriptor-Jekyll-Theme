Our research group activity drew attention of one of the largest newspapers in Estonia and "Postimees" published an article named ["Can't attend the event yourself? No problem, relepresence robot can"](https://teadus.postimees.ee/7653783/ise-ei-saa-kohale-minna-pole-viga-kaugosalusrobot-laheb).
The article was discussed on the television the next day, which we are very happy about, however the host skipped "read the article yourself" homework and remained wondering what the application of telepresence robots might be. We would be more than happy to explain that in many details should we be given an opportunity.
