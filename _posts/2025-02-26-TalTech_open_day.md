Our research group recently participated in TalTech's Open Day, where we offered visitors the opportunity to test their interest and suitability for the IT field. To introduce the three bachelor's degree programs at the IT College, we used the TEMI robot, allowing students to complete multiple-choice tests.

The event provided a valuable opportunity for students to discuss their interests and ideas with experienced professionals in the field. It also allowed supervisors to share their expertise and offer insights into potential research topics. By fostering these connections, we hope to create a collaborative environment that benefits both students and supervisors. ðŸŒŸðŸ”—
