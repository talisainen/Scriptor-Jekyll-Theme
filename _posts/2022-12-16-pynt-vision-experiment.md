In the PYNT educational community's remote-controlled robot experiment, the behavior of people was studied.

The PYNT educational community's annual meeting took place on December 15, 2022 at TalTech IT College. During the meeting, there were teaching workshops and robot experiments to see if communication through a telepresence robot would change a person's behavior. The experiment involved a simulated communication situation in which a person in the room with the telepresence robot had to approach a colleague present in the room and invite them to dinner. In this situation, social distancing and eye contact had to be maintained, information had to be shared on the robot's screen, and the person had to be ready to read text from paper. All of these situations are typical of interactions that take place in higher education, where the operator of the robot needs both skills and patience. In addition, the three models of robots were ranked to find the favorites.
