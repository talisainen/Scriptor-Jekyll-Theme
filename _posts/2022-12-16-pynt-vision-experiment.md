In the PYNT educational community's remote-controlled robot experiment, the behavior of people was studied.

The PYNT educational community's annual meeting took place on December 15, 2022 at TalTech IT College. During the meeting, there were teaching workshops and robot experiments to see if communication through a telepresence robot would change a person's behavior. The experiment involved a simulated communication situation in which a person in the room with the telepresence robot had to approach a colleague present in the room and invite them to dinner. In this situation, social distancing and eye contact had to be maintained, information had to be shared on the robot's screen, and the person had to be ready to read text from paper. All of these situations are typical of interactions that take place in higher education, where the operator of the robot needs both skills and patience. In addition, the three models of robots were ranked to find the favorites.



<!-- In addition to the participation in the seminar we visited Dr. [Ismail Khalil](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ismail-Khalil-6) and Dr. [Karin Anna Hummel](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karin-Hummel-3) from the Institute of Cooperation of Johannes Kepler University research interests lay within human-machine and machine-machine interaction, and also IoT sensors.
We share the belief that telepresence robots could strongly benefit from the results of Ismail and Karin research.

Professor [Zsolt Lavicza](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zsolt-Lavicza) our research group met the next day shared his considerations on STEM education research methods that our [EuroteQ course](/documents/Enhancing-Social-Interaction-in-Education-and-Business-by-using-Telepresence-Robots-ICY0032.pdf) on social interactions using telepresence robots will greatly benefit from. We are looking forward to future cooperation. -->

The campus of [Johannes Kepler University](https://www.jku.at/en) is worth a separate mention, as an example of a stylish and at the same time cozy place to work and rest, located in the most picturesque landscape one could imagine. We can only envy our colleagues, but in a polite way, of course.

Travel tip: although there is an airport in Linz be sure to take the train, otherwise you might end up being the only person who took a flight to the city. In addition to that dubious achievement train schedule is much more flexible. -->
