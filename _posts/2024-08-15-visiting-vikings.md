Modern technologies and Scandinavian history, that's what the EdTech Estonia workshop is all about.\
The pseudo-historic location [Viikingite k√ºla](https://www.viikingitekyla.ee/en/) (Viking's village) was chosen as the venue. Since Janika Leoste was in Spain at the time of the seminar, she took part in it with the help of a telepresence robot; a method which became rather a commonplace than an exception in our team.
The EdTech project is dedicated to the development of educational technologies in Estonia and Janika shared her thoughts on the possibilities of cooperation and financing of educational projects.
