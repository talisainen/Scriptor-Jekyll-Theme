Today, our research group had the opportunity to visit the Institute of Health Technologies, where Janika Loeste presented our findings on the use of telepresence robots. This visit was a fantastic chance to share our knowledge and discuss the potential applications of this technology in education, healthcare and beyond.

During our presentation, we highlighted some key insights from our research. One of the most significant aspects we explored was how telepresence robots can enhance the sense of presence and engagement for remote users. We also discussed technical challenges, such as navigation in complex environments, latency issues, and the need for intuitive user interfaces. 

We look forward to continuing our collaboration with the Institute of Health Technologies and further exploring ways to optimize and implement this technology in our professional and practical everyday life.
