On December 14th and 15th, 2022, our cooperation partners from the Universities of Jyväskylä and Eindhoven visited the IT College, where they met with members of the research group Janika Leoste, Kalle Tammemäe, Jaanus Pöial, Tariq Meeran, and Kristel Marmor. We gave an overview of the experiments and research we conducted with remote-controlled robots in 2022. Colleagues Johanna Pöysä-Tarhonen, Päivi Häkkinen, Kristof Fenyvesi, and Takumi Yada from Jyväskylä University introduced innovative methods of education research. Martijn Klabbers and John Heijligers from Eindhoven University discussed why to use challenge-based learning method in education - not for faster or better learning, but to be able to search, explore, and add new knowledge and solve real-world problems. John Heijligers shared his thoughts on how to make educational videos - through storytelling. We exchanged ideas on what scientific topics are of mutual interest to us and agreed on joint scientific projects to pursue in 2023.
