On December 14th and 15th, 2022, our cooperation partners from the Universities of Jyväskylä and Eindhoven visited the IT College, where they met with members of the research group Janika Leoste, Kalle Tammemäe, Jaanus Pöial, Tariq Meeran, and Kristel Marmor. We gave an overview of the experiments and research we conducted with remote-controlled robots in 2022. Colleagues Johanna Pöysä-Tarhonen, Päivi Häkkinen, Kristof Fenyvesi, and Takumi Yada from Jyväskylä University introduced innovative methods of education research. Martijn Klabbers and John Heijligers from Eindhoven University discussed why to use challenge-based learning method in education - not for faster or better learning, but to be able to search, explore, and add new knowledge and solve real-world problems. John Heijligers shared his thoughts on how to make educational videos - through storytelling. We exchanged ideas on what scientific topics are of mutual interest to us and agreed on joint scientific projects to pursue in 2023.


<!-- In addition to the participation in the seminar we visited Dr. [Ismail Khalil](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ismail-Khalil-6) and Dr. [Karin Anna Hummel](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karin-Hummel-3) from the Institute of Cooperation of Johannes Kepler University research interests lay within human-machine and machine-machine interaction, and also IoT sensors.
We share the belief that telepresence robots could strongly benefit from the results of Ismail and Karin research.

Professor [Zsolt Lavicza](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zsolt-Lavicza) our research group met the next day shared his considerations on STEM education research methods that our [EuroteQ course](/documents/Enhancing-Social-Interaction-in-Education-and-Business-by-using-Telepresence-Robots-ICY0032.pdf) on social interactions using telepresence robots will greatly benefit from. We are looking forward to future cooperation. -->

The campus of [Johannes Kepler University](https://www.jku.at/en) is worth a separate mention, as an example of a stylish and at the same time cozy place to work and rest, located in the most picturesque landscape one could imagine. We can only envy our colleagues, but in a polite way, of course.

Travel tip: although there is an airport in Linz be sure to take the train, otherwise you might end up being the only person who took a flight to the city. In addition to that dubious achievement train schedule is much more flexible. -->
