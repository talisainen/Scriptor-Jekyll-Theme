Every year TalTech hosts a festival of innovations, where scientists and research groups can present their findings that have already reached at least a prototype stage and can be demonstrated in a working condition.\
This year we concentrated our efforts on [Temi](https://www.robottemi.com) assistant robot that has more capabilities, comparing to other telepresence robots that we have. This is a more sophisticated model, whose functionality goes beyond creating a communication channel and driving around under user control. Temi has a LIDAR, it can map the environment and operate autonomously or semi-autonomously relieving its operator from the necessity of manual driving.
