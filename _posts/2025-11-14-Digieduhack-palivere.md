IT Didactics recently organized a youth-focused hackathon under the European Commission’s **DigiEduHack initiative**, bringing together creativity, innovation, and future-ready digital skills. The event was co-organized by **Prof. Janika Leoste** and **Prof. Slavko Rakić** from the IT Didactics Research Group at TalTech IT College, in collaboration with **Ülemiste City** and the **International School of Tallinn**.
This hackathon was designed as part of the ongoing **DITEC project**, aiming to support upskilling of students and fostering digital competences that the future workforce will need. By engaging with the community, we are expanding the impact of our research and strengthening the bridge between schools, universities, and the labor market.

**A Hackathon Powered by Secondary Students’ Talent**

Around 25 secondary-school students took part in the competition, working intensely to develop meaningful and innovative solutions. The winning team, **EcoQuest Ülemiste**, impressed the jury with their creativity, technical thinking, and social impact.
Their final solution can be viewed here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1REb-XhcosHjrAhBdv_D4zQw99TD81e8h/view?usp=drivesdk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1REb-XhcosHjrAhBdv_D4zQw99TD81e8h/view?usp=drivesdk)

Outreach Visit to Palivere School: Robots, AI, and the Future of Learning
The day after the hackathon, Prof. Leoste and Prof. Rakić visited **Palivere School**, bringing along the telepresence robot used in TalTech research activities. Our early-stage researcher **Tiina Kasuk** demonstrated how telepresence robots can support inclusive education, remote participation, and new forms of student engagement.

During the visit, we also shared experiences from DigiEduHack and introduced several ongoing international projects, including:

•	**DITEC – Didactic Technologies for IT Education**

•	**HIAS – Hybrid Intelligent Assessment System**

•	**Comparative Study of ICT Competencies and Labour Market Needs in Kenya, Nigeria, and Armenia**

This outreach activity helped inspire students, showed them real examples of educational innovation, and sparked curiosity about how technology shapes the future of learning.

**Building Impact for the Next Generation**

Through both the hackathon and the Pelivere School visit, we demonstrated how IT College and the IT Didactics research group actively contribute to educational innovation in Estonia. By engaging with young learners and empowering them to co-create solutions, we help build a digitally competent, motivated, and future-ready generation.
These activities reaffirm our belief that **innovation begins with students**, and that universities have a strong responsibility to open doors, share knowledge, and shape a better digital society.
