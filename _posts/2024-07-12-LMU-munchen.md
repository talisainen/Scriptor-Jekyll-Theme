What would a robotic arm in the middle of a kitchen remind you of? Joi from "Blade Runner 2049"? "There Will Come Soft Rains" cartoon? No, it's a robotics lab in Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München.

Initially we came across an [article](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3613905.3637144) where our colleagues described their view of reducing cognitive load of teachers during hybrid study sessions by designing a telepresence robot of their own, and Aleksei Talisainen from our research group contacted the authors of the article to ask if there would be a possibility to pay a visit and discuss their research and possible means of collaboration. It appeared however, that in addition to the telepresence robot prototype, which is rather interesting by itself our colleagues conduct very serious and intersting reseach in robotics. We are looking forward to sharing knowledge with them in future.
