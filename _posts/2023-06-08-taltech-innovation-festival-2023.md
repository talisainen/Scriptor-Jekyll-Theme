TalTech innovation festival is a yearly event that is dedicated to some stirring problems in technology domain.
This year the slogan of the festival was "Health comes from TalTech" and though our students studying day and night in pursuit of knowledge may argue on that, we cannot agree more that Tallinn University of Technology research is tightly related to medicine, healthcare, and by all means telepresence robots in healthcare.
