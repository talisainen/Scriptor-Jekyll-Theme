On December 13, 2022, Janika Leoste, Katrin Kangur, and Kristel Marmor visited the technology transfer center of Taltech to present a start grant on the topic of telepresence robots in hospital work. We presented to the commission the benefits of using a telepresence robot compared to communication through other screens, the flexible solutions that using a telepresence robot in a hospital offers to doctors and nurses, and how to facilitate information exchange through the robot between the patient and hospital staff as well as the patient and their relatives/acquaintances. The start grant allows for testing of robots in both hospitals and simulation labs. Our cooperation partners in this project are Ida-Tallinn Central Hospital and Tallinn Health College, who have also provided us with specific ideas and requests for the use of telepresence robots.


<!-- In addition to the participation in the seminar we visited Dr. [Ismail Khalil](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ismail-Khalil-6) and Dr. [Karin Anna Hummel](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Karin-Hummel-3) from the Institute of Cooperation of Johannes Kepler University research interests lay within human-machine and machine-machine interaction, and also IoT sensors.
We share the belief that telepresence robots could strongly benefit from the results of Ismail and Karin research.

Professor [Zsolt Lavicza](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zsolt-Lavicza) our research group met the next day shared his considerations on STEM education research methods that our [EuroteQ course](/documents/Enhancing-Social-Interaction-in-Education-and-Business-by-using-Telepresence-Robots-ICY0032.pdf) on social interactions using telepresence robots will greatly benefit from. We are looking forward to future cooperation. -->

The campus of [Johannes Kepler University](https://www.jku.at/en) is worth a separate mention, as an example of a stylish and at the same time cozy place to work and rest, located in the most picturesque landscape one could imagine. We can only envy our colleagues, but in a polite way, of course.

Travel tip: although there is an airport in Linz be sure to take the train, otherwise you might end up being the only person who took a flight to the city. In addition to that dubious achievement train schedule is much more flexible. -->
