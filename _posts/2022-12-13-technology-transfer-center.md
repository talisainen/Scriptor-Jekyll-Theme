On December 13, 2022, Janika Leoste, Katrin Kangur, and Kristel Marmor visited the technology transfer center of Taltech to present a start grant on the topic of telepresence robots in hospital work. We presented to the commission the benefits of using a telepresence robot compared to communication through other screens, the flexible solutions that using a telepresence robot in a hospital offers to doctors and nurses, and how to facilitate information exchange through the robot between the patient and hospital staff as well as the patient and their relatives/acquaintances. The start grant allows for testing of robots in both hospitals and simulation labs. Our cooperation partners in this project are Ida-Tallinn Central Hospital and Tallinn Health College, who have also provided us with specific ideas and requests for the use of telepresence robots.
