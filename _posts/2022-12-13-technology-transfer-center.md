On December 13, 2022, Janika Leoste, Katrin Kangur, and Kristel Marmor visited the technology transfer center of Taltech to present a start grant on the topic of telepresence robots in hospital work.\
We presented the benefits of using a telepresence robot compared to communication through other screens, the flexible solutions that using a telepresence robot in a hospital offers to doctors and nurses to the commission, and explained how to facilitate information exchange through the robot between the patient and hospital staff as well as the patient and their relatives/acquaintances. The start grant gives us an opportunity of testing the robots in both hospitals and simulation labs. Our cooperation partners in this project are East Tallinn Central Hospital ( Ida-Tallinna keskhaigla) and Tallinn Health College (Tallinna Tervishoiu KÃµrgkool), who have also provided us with specific ideas and requests for the use of telepresence robots.
