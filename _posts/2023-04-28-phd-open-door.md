Tallinn University of Technology organized an event called "Open Doors Evening" for PhD students [FB page](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?vanity=itteaduskond&set=a.703911711533522). The idea behind the event was to aquaint the students with active research groups on the university and faculty of infotechnology in particular. We were happy to parcitipate and Ohmni robot bravely interfered with the speech of the dean, [Gert Jervan](https://www.etis.ee/CV/Gert_Jervan/eng). After all, you can never be sure of who drove the robot to make accusation of being impolite.
