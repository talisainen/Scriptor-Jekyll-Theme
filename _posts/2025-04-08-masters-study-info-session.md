Yesterday, our research group had the pleasure of participating in the TalTech Master's Info Session – an event aimed at introducing prospective students to the university’s master's programmes, research opportunities, and academic environment. We were excited to share our ongoing work while hopefully inspiring future students to join our field.

The info evening provided a great platform to present what we do as a research group – from current projects and research directions to how master’s students can actively contribute. Many visitors approached us with questions about research topics, internship opportunities, and thesis supervision.

For us, the event was also an opportunity to gain insight into what future students are curious about. This kind of feedback is invaluable as we continue shaping our research directions and developing topics that are both impactful and inspiring.

A big thank you to everyone who stopped by our booth! We look forward to hopefully seeing many of you join TalTech master´s study this autumn!
