On Monday, February 3rd, we had the pleasure of meeting with students from the IT Systems Administration and IT Systems Development programs. The purpose of this gathering was to connect these talented students with potential supervisors and topics for their final theses. 🤝📚

As part of the TILK project, we have decided to closely examine the thesis process at IT College and address any concerns that may arise. This initiative aims to streamline the process and ensure that students receive the guidance and support they need to successfully complete their final projects. 🛠️✨

The event provided a valuable opportunity for students to discuss their interests and ideas with experienced professionals in the field. It also allowed supervisors to share their expertise and offer insights into potential research topics. By fostering these connections, we hope to create a collaborative environment that benefits both students and supervisors. 🌟🔗
