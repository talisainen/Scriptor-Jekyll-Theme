On May 8-th we opened the doors of our research group for an Open Lab event, held as part of the ESAK 2 pre-conference day: Human in the Age of Technological Upheavals.
Together with Janika Leoste, Jaanus Pöial, Kalle Tammemäe, Katrin Aasma, and Palmi Lahe, we shared our experiences of working with telepresence robots and robotassistants in both educational and healthcare contexts.

Visitors had the opportunity to explore our lab, try out the robots firsthand, and engage in discussions about how robotics and AI are reshaping how we teach, learn, and care for others. We demonstrated our TEMI, Double, Ohmni and Strech robots.
The great interest from participants confirmed what we already believe: human-centered technological solutions are key to ensuring that innovation remains inclusive, supportive, and socially meaningful.
A big thank you to everyone who joined us today – your curiosity, questions, and reflections help inspire the future of our research!
