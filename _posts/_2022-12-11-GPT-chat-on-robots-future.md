There has been a lot of hype about [OpenAI chatbot](https://chat.openai.com/chat) that uses neural networks to give almost conscious answers and causing problems in schools because is writes outstanding essays and working computer code, so we decided to put its forecasting abilities to test. Although the AI was very cautions in its predictions, we generally agree to its opinion.


The event in Kuressaare deserves special mention, because for the first time in our practice, the robot was used in a very large audience.
Since the capabilities of the built-in microphone were obviously insufficient for such a hall, auxiliary measures had to be taken.

Kuressaare is the biggest city on a rather remote [Saaremaa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saaremaa) island and telepresence robot is exactly what you need if a two-hour drive on snowy roads and a ferry crossing isn't your dream plan for a weekend.

We had to improvise and it appears that [lavelier microphone]([lavalier microphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavalier_microphone) is totally compatible with Double 3 robot, although the transmiteer/battery module should have been places lower on the pole not to jeopardize stability
