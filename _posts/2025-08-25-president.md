Still hard to believe, but it actually happened: our robots shared the stage with the President of Estonia! 

On September 1st, during President Alar Karis’s speech marking the beginning of the new school year, our Telepresence Robots and Robot Assistants Lab had the honor of supporting this special occasion.

It was an incredibly proud and exciting moment for our research group to see our robots in action at a national event dedicated to education – a celebration of knowledge, growth, and the role it plays in shaping society. Having our technology play even a small part in such an event made the moment truly unforgettable.

None of this would have been possible without the brilliant team who brought the robots to life: Kristel Marmor, Aleksei Talisainen, Katrin Aasma, Annika Raie, and Leo Benjamin Leoste.  You were the heartbeat inside the machines, making the robots more than just tech — you made them partners in the celebration.

We’re beyond grateful and inspired to keep pushing forward in human–robot collaboration, education technology, and research that makes a difference.
