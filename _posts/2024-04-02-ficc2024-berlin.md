So, what would you do if you didn't sleep well and forgot to smile for the photo? All it takes is a little touch of Photoshop magic that people will barely notice.

Aleksei Talisainen participated in Future of Information and Communication conference in Berlin with a presentation on using telepresence robots in our [EuroTeQ course](documents/Enhancing-Social-Interaction-in-Education-and-Business-by-using-Telepresence-Robots-ICY0032.pdf).

The presentation was based on the article "Understanding the Potential of Telepresence Robots in Higher Education Learning: A Case Study" published in 2023 and the slides of the presentation can be downloaded from [here](documents/2024-04-02-ficc2024-slides.pdf)
