We are excited to share that several of our members recently participated in the 16th International Conference on Robotics in Education (RIE 2025), which was held live in Thessaloniki, Greece.

RIE is a prestigious annual event that brings together educators, researchers, and innovators from around the world to explore the latest developments in robotics and their application in education. This year’s conference featured a dynamic program of keynote speeches, paper presentations, hands-on workshops, and networking sessions—all focused on advancing robotics education and promoting STEM learning at all levels.

Our members had the opportunity to attend a variety of sessions covering topics such as educational robotics platforms, curriculum integration, AI in the classroom, and innovative teaching methodologies. It was an inspiring and energizing experience that sparked new ideas and opened doors for potential collaborations.
Being part of RIE 2025 not only deepened our members’ expertise in the field but also strengthened our international connections within the robotics and education communities.
We are proud of our members’ engagement and look forward to sharing more insights and takeaways from the conference soon.
