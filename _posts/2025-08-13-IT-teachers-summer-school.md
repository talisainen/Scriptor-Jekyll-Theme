At the recent IT Teachers’ Summer School, we explored how robot assistants can support learning and teaching in school environments. The workshop focused on sharing practical experiences and demonstrating real-life use cases where robotic tools can make education more inclusive and efficient.

We discussed several ways robot assistants can be integrated into daily school life. These included helping with routine tasks such as registering students for lessons, enabling remote participation for learners who cannot attend in person, and supporting students who need additional help after being absent.

One of the highlights of the workshop was introducing participants to the Temi robot assistant. This versatile tool allows students and teachers to connect with classrooms in new ways. For example, Temi can be used to virtually move around in a different learning environment, giving remote participants a more immersive and interactive experience than traditional video conferencing.

Participants had the chance to test the Temi robot themselves, experiencing firsthand what it feels like to “walk” through another space and engage with the learning process remotely. The feedback showed that such tools can open up exciting opportunities for more flexible, inclusive, and engaging education.
