When you think of global education leaders, places like Finland or Singapore often come to mind. But quietly and consistently, Estonia has been outshining many of its European neighbors—and even the world.
Janika Leoste—Assistant Professor of IT Didactics at Tallinn University of Technology, and head of the IT Didactics research group—recently shared insights into what makes Estonia’s educational success so effective. And spoiler: it’s not about banning smartphones or endless testing.

1. **Teachers Rule the Classroom**

Estonian teachers aren’t handed a script—they write it. With high autonomy, educators decide what happens in class, what materials to use, and how to meet their students’ needs. That trust fuels both teacher motivation and innovative teaching.

2. **Technology Is a Friend, Not a Foe**

Gone are blanket bans on devices. In Estonia, mobile phones, laptops, and tablets are integrated meaningfully into learning. Teachers choose apps, robots, and digital tools that enhance instruction—making tech a powerful ally rather than a distraction.

3. **Collaboration Powers Progress**

Estonia’s success comes from a holistic ecosystem—strong collaboration among the government, schools, businesses, and researchers. Educational policies and practices are informed by real-world evidence, not guesswork.

**No Magic, Just Smart Policy**

As Janika Leoste put it, Estonia’s education system reflects national values rather than a miracle. Thoughtful policymaking, respect for teachers, and smart innovation—not luck—are behind its top-of-the-chart performance.
