This systematic literature review, conducted using the Kitchenham approach, examines the period from January 2019 to February 2024, analyzing 30 key studies that showcase the potential of robots in:

â€¢	Supporting lectures

â€¢	Enhancing teaching practices

â€¢	Improving learning outcomes


Our findings highlight the transformative potential of robot assistants to deliver personalized support and redefine learning experiences. However, for this potential to be realized, we must address:

â€¢	Technical limitations of robots

â€¢	Policy clarity

â€¢	Teacher training for effective integration
