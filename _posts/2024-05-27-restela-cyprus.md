ReSTELA project is coming to an end and our partners arranged a meeting to discuss the final arrangements of this undertaking aimed to provide robotics education to rural areas and places, where no robots labs are available. Remote presence is an important factor in arranging such labs and telepresence robots offer an ideal solution.\
Cyprus is a place of ancient churches and power plug connectors, of bright sun and outstanding diving, but even more than that it is a place to find a lot of hospitable people and we are thankful to our partners from [ECECT](https://ecect.eu) European Center for their warm welcome.
