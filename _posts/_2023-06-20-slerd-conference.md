This year, the conference on [Smart Learning Ecosystems and Regional Development](http://slerd2019.uniroma2.it/programme/) (SLERD) took place at Tallinn University.

Our research group was presented by [Mohammad Tariq Meeran](https://www.etis.ee/CV/Mohammad%20Tariq_Meeran/eng/) and [Tiina Kasuk](https://www.etis.ee/CV/Tiina_Kasuk/eng/) who made oral presentations.

As an active participant of Erasmus+ project TEACH4EDU4 project, Tiina made a presentation dedicated to academic staff perceptions and attitudes towards learning analytics and it contained a brief overview of the current learning analytics methods used in Estonian higher education institutions based on Tallinn University and TalTech. 



As a footnote, although we have photos from the afterparty, it was decided not to post them here - let this be a hidden advertisement of our next conference.
