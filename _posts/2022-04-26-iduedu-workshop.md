[iduEDU](https://www.tallinn.ee/et/uudis/iduedu-2022-festival-onnelik-oppija-krihvli-voi-tahvliga-registreeri-kuni-1904) is an educational festival in [Tallinn Seconday School of Science](https://real.edu.ee/en/about/), where our group took part this year.

The workshop titled “What if the teacher comes to the class as a robot?” brought in about a dozen people and resulted in a lively discussion. Janika Leoste, who was physically in Norway, telepresented herself via a Double 3 robot.
Due to shortage of robots Jaanus and Kaido were present in person, however the perceived difference was pretty marginal 🙂
