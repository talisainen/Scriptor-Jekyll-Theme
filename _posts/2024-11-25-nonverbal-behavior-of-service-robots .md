Our study dives deep into the fascinating world of nonverbal communication in human-robot interactions (HRI), specifically focusing on socially capable service robots. Here's what we uncovered:
✅ Types of service robots studied in HRI research
✅ Key nonverbal cues in interactions between humans and robots
✅ Research objectives, participant profiles, and data collection methods
✅ Insights shaping trust, self-efficacy, and overcoming cultural differences in HRI

🔍 Key Takeaways:
From our review of 39 academic papers (2006–2023), it's evident that nonverbal communication plays a crucial role in fostering trust and improving the quality of interaction. However, there is significant room to further explore and enhance how service robots adapt to human expectations and cultural dynamics.

Let’s strengthen the bond between humans and robots through more meaningful and intuitive interactions!
