It’s not every day you get invited on TV, so this was a pretty exciting experience for our team leader Janika Leoste and doctoral student Kristel Marmor. They shared insights into our ongoing research and how we’re already putting our robots to use in real-world settings.
Big thanks to the show for having us – we’re always thrilled to spread the word about the amazing work happening in our team!
