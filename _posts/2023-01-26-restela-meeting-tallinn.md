Joint meeting for all [ReSTELA project](https://cm.taltech.ee/restela-project-starting) participants took place in Tallinn this week.
A research group from Cyprus, led by Professor George Georgiou, presented their perspective on the project infrastructure, and Aleksei Talisainen from TalTech provided an overview of our vision for using telepresence robots in the project.

During the meeting, participants discussed previous efforts in creating remote robotics labs. Professor Georgiou presented several test labs that operate on a centralized infrastructure using virtual machines. It was concluded that this approach is more flexible and scalable than using micro-computers such as Raspberry Pi, and it was decided to continue the joint development using server infrastructure. Aleksei Talisainen from TalTech presented a stand-alone lab prototype and a telepresence robot for monitoring it.\
The group also discussed potential challenges and pitfalls, and scheduled the next meeting.
