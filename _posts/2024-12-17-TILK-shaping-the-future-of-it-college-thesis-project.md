On December 17, 2024, an inspiring brainstorming session took place at Voldemar Restaurant, bringing together IT College faculty members, students, and IT didactics research group to map out the challenges of the IT College thesis process and sketch out potential solutions.
The seminar was organized as part of the **TILK (Scientific Innovative Approaches and Meetings)** project. Participants highlighted several key issues related to student preparation, supervision quality, and the thesis evaluation process.

Key Focus Areas:
â€¢	Supporting students in the early stages of research.
The need for clear guidelines and tools to make starting a thesis easier and more accessible was emphasized.
â€¢	Improving collaboration between supervisors and students.
Ideas were discussed on how to create a smoother and more structured supervision process that supports student development while reducing the workload for supervisors.
â€¢	Clarity and objectivity in evaluation criteria.
Suggestions were made to make the thesis assessment process more consistent and transparent.

We extend our heartfelt thanks to all the faculty members, students, and project contributors who dedicated their time and shared valuable insights. Together, we can build a system that makes thesis work more effective and motivating for both students and supervisors.

The TILK Project Continues!

The next step involves analyzing the gathered ideas and developing concrete solutions. 

See you at the next discussions! ðŸš€
