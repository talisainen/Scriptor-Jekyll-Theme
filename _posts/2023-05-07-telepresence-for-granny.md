Yesterday one of the students of our [Eurotech University course](/documents/Enhancing-Social-Interaction-in-Education-and-Business-by-using-Telepresence-Robots-ICY0032.pdf) submitted an assignment with the description of a telepresence robot "in the simplest way possible". Although his explanation if hard to translate from Estonian, it might (with minor modifications) make a great introduction for an article.

> The practice demonstrated that my initial hypothesis “Telepresence robots are some pitiful clothes hangers” appeared to be wrong. With all their drawbacks these gadgets have something in them and I learned how to find use for it.
> I am totally awaer that when the lecturer reads this text, he won’t be too happy about it and will find many ways to change my mind, there in nothing bad in that actually.
> So, how do I explain to a granny or a child (in other words, in some funny way) what that mystic “telepresence robot” is?
> Well… Imagine that shaft of a mop, standing in a bucket. Let the bucket have some wheels too, imagine that? But! That’s not all!  Let there be a screen atop in. Not like a windscreen or smth, but kinda TV screen. Get it? And you can drive that doofer places where you don’t really wanna be.
> Don’t feel like hanging out with your buddies? No bother, they pull the robot from the closet and you can show your face at any party. How does it work? Well, not that I actually knew, ask the teacher. Alright, you power up your computer, click on some link and turn the camera and mic on. Then you can use “gamer keys” or arrows to move around as if you were right there. Don’t be pissed off, the robot is kinda clumsy, you’ll get used to that. In case you still didn’t get it, I added a sketch.
