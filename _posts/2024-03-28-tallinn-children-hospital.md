Our research group has established new contacts with Pihlakodu care home chain as well as Tallinn Children’s Hospital. Both institutions are very interested in implementing robot assistants in their daily activities. For example, Pihlakodu is interested in robot assistants helping both to entertain and guide their clients in their daily activities, as well as using telepresence robots for remote access to medical services. Tallinn Children’s Hospital is looking forward to employ a house guide to their ambulatory offices – a friendly robot guide helping children and their parents to find the right rooms as well as to help to reduce stress and create a child-friendly service environment. Together with our research group we are looking for closer collaboration as well as funding opportunities to make these plans a reality.
