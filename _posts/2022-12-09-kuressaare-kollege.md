The event in Kuressaare deserves special mention, because for the first time in our practice, the robot was used in a very large audience.
Since the capabilities of the built-in microphone were obviously insufficient for such a hall, auxiliary measures had to be taken.

Kuressaare is the biggest city on a rather remote [Saaremaa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saaremaa) island and telepresence robot is exactly what you need if a two-hour drive on snowy roads and a ferry crossing isn't your dream plan for a weekend.

We had to improvise and it appears that [lavelier microphone]([lavalier microphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavalier_microphone) is totally compatible with Double 3 robot, although the transmiteer/battery module should have been places lower on the pole not to jeopardize stability
