As we all know (and heard many jokes about) different people have their own understanding of the distance kept from a person they are communicating with. In depends on many factors, such as personality, culture, and well, eyesight :-) so during one of our discussions we asked ourselves a question: how far would a person stand from a telepresence robot during the communication with a person controlling it? After all, it is a person you are talking to. Or a robot? Being a research group we decided to conduct an experiment.

During one of our workshops, we created different simulated situations, where the participants would have certain discussions with someone represented as a Double 3 robot and we made our best to keep them unaware that we are making measurements. After that we compared our findings with the results of numerous studies investigating the distance people tend to keep during human-to-human communication and it appears that the distance people kept was somewhere near the borderline between a personal and social distancing of people from Northern Europe. Also, we found some correlation between the habit to play computer games and the distance the participants kept.

So, to demonstrate the outcomes of our effort we published [an article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2022.1046461/full), where the results are discussed in further details.
