ReSTELA is an acronym for *Remote STEM Labs* and a joint project between TalTech IT College (that's us), [European Centre for Emerging Competencies and Technologies](https://ecect.eu/) and [Scuola di Robotica](https://www.scuoladirobotica.it/en/home-eng/).

All three participating organizations have substantial experience in the field of the research and the project has the potential to add to the existing knowledge and practices of all three. 
The participating organizations create a perfect mix in terms of profile (research center, NGO and HEI) and wer are excited to see the results of the cooperation.

Things we love about the project: the outputs of our combined efforts will be freely available for all parties interested, including full description of the platform and materials as well as detailed description of the labs we create.
