There has been a lot of hype about [OpenAI chatbot](https://chat.openai.com/chat) that uses neural networks to give almost conscious answers and causing problems in schools because is writes outstanding essays and working computer code, so we decided to put its forecasting abilities to test. Although the AI was very cautions in its predictions, we generally agree to its opinion and Janika Leoste [delivered a keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhth2bc7gZ4) on the same topic earlier this week.

Although somewhat longer, the keynote gives in-depth analysis of the current situation and suggests possible prospects for the use of telepresence robots both in general and in higher education in particular, and we sincerely recommend watching it.
