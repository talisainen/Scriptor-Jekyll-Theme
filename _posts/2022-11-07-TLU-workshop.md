Aleksei, Janika and Kristel from our research group gave a workshop on telepresence robotics to 50 general education teachers in Tallinn University at November 1. Together we explored the functionality and limitations of the Double 3, Ohmni and Temi robots. Teachers were moderately optimistic of imaging their future in telepresence mode.

Temi, a newcomer to our fleet of Double 3 and Ohmni robots made its first (incredibly positive) appearance.

Temi is quite different from the robots we currently have at our disposal. While moving around the building it creates a map, a floot plan that it can use to move independently between named reference points.
