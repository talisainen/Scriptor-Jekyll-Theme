Over the past month, the IT Didactics Research Group has demonstrated an exceptional level of activity, impact, and visibility across all dimensions of the Quadruple Helix—academia, industry, policy makers, and society. Our team engaged in major international conferences, strategic roundtables, policy dialogues, international development projects, and research-focused seminars, while also contributing to the development of next-generation AI-supported teaching and assessment practices. Below is a consolidated overview of our key achievements.

In the same month, **Prof. Leoste and Prof. Rakić** represented our research group at the DigiEduHack Main Stage Event in Brussels.

They contributed to two expert discussions on the future of digital education, AI ethics, and innovation ecosystems.

The event was officially opened by: Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen
Director-General, DG Education, Culture, Youth and Sport (European Commission)

Their participation strengthened the visibility of TalTech’s leadership in shaping European digital education policy.

**Academia–Industry Collaboration: DITEC Project Roundtable**

Within the framework of the ongoing Erasmus+ DITEC project, a high-level roundtable between academia and industry was organized by:

•	Kristel Marmor

•	Voldemar Tomusk

•	Janika Leoste

•	Slavko Rakić

The roundtable resulted in the creation of seven company case studies, which will be integrated into our curriculum to bridge the skills gap and better prepare students for modern IT roles.

**New International Development Project: ESTDEV Gap Analysis for Kenya, Nigeria, and Armenia**

{% include image_caption.html imageurl="/images/2025-11-30-november-activities/Kenya.jpg" %}

A new project funded by the Estonian Centre for International Development (ESTDEV) was officially launched this month: “Gap Analysis of Kenyan ICT Higher Education and Labour Market Needs with Comparative Reflections on Nigeria and Armenia.”

The project aims to analyse digital and ICT competency gaps between university curricula and labour market demands in emerging economies.

As part of the project’s initiation phase, Voldemar Tomusk visited several universities in Kenya to begin the skill-gap assessment and establish collaboration with academic and industry stakeholders. This marks an important expansion of our research group’s global development footprint and reinforces Estonia’s role in supporting digital capacity building worldwide.

**Scientific Impact: International Conference Contributions**

18th International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (Seville)
Our group made strong contributions through two conference papers:
