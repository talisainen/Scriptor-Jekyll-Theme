Tiia R端端tmann, Head of the Centre for Teaching Excellence of School of Engineering at TalTech wrote a [post in Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7259839880531177472/) about introducing telepresence robots into her course.
In her classes Prof. R端端tmann uses active learning methods therefore teleconferencing falls short of expectations and teaching happens only in person, however telepresence robots seem to have covered the gap and in her post Tiia expressed satisfaction with the results.
