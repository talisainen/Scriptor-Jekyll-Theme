From September 10–12, 2025, our research group had the opportunity to take part in the International Conference on Social Robotics + AI (ICSR 2025), hosted in Naples, Italy. The conference theme, “Emotivation at the Core: Empowering Social Robots to Inspire and Connect,” set the stage for three days of insightful discussions, presentations, and collaborations on the future of social robotics.

About the Conference

ICSR is one of the leading international forums bringing together researchers, practitioners, and industry partners to discuss advances in social robotics, artificial intelligence, and human–robot interaction. The 2025 edition placed a strong emphasis on the role of emotions and motivation in building meaningful connections between robots and people.
