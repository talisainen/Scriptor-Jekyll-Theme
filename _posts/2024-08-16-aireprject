TalTech IT Didactics Research Group and Pihlakodu AS started a collaboration within the AIRE (AI & Robotics Estonia) demoproject, where the usage scenarios of the TEMI robot as an activity supervisor are designed to improve the well-being of the elderly in nursing homes, the necessary application is adapted for this purpose and it is validated as a solution to assist the activity supervisors in the daily work of Viimsi and Tabasalu nursing homes. The main goal of the project is to increase the well-being of bedridden clients by offering them an additional means of obtaining information and socializing and to test the possibility of reducing the challenges caused by the lack of nursing home staff, especially in the care of the elderly who need a more personal approach. 
On the 1st of August under the leadership of research team leader Janika Leoste, a training session on the use of the TEMI robot was held for the employees of Viimsi and Tabasalu Pihlakodu, where the general capabilities of TEMI and the application created for the nursing home were introduced.
